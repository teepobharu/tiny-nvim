> Slim Neovim config for 0.11+ with minimal plugins.

[![Slim Neovim config for 0.11](https://i.gyazo.com/6e351d72c2f119f70dbc55d61e9452fd.png)](https://gyazo.com/6e351d72c2f119f70dbc55d61e9452fd)

## Motivation

This configuration is a migration from [my-nvim-ide](https://github.com/jellydn/my-nvim-ide) with two main goals:

1. **Leverage Neovim 0.11+ Built-in Features**:
   - Remove dependency on [`lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3659) by utilizing Neovim's built-in LSP support
   - No need for the `mason.nvim` plugin; instead, use a shell [script](./scripts/install-tools.sh) to install necessary tools
   - Experience faster startup times and reduced complexity
   - Take advantage of the latest Neovim improvements

2. **Optimize Plugin Selection**:
   - Trim down the plugin list to only essential ones
   - Use `blink.cmp` for completion instead of built-in completion for better UX
   - Maintain a minimal yet powerful development environment

3. **Adopt mini.nvim as Core UI Framework**:
   - Migrate from snacks.nvim to mini.nvim for better integration
   - Use consistent plugin ecosystem from the same author
   - Reduce dependencies while maintaining feature parity

The result is a faster, more maintainable configuration that still provides all the necessary features for modern development.

### 🏠 [Homepage](itman.fyi)

## Quick Start

### One-liner Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install with default app name (tiny-nvim)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim/main/install.sh | bash

# Or install with custom app name
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --appname my_nvim
```

This will:

1. Backup your existing Neovim configuration (if any)
2. Clone the repository
3. Install all required tools
4. Install all plugins in headless mode
5. Set up your complete Neovim environment

After installation, you can start Neovim with:

```bash
# If using default app name
NVIM_APPNAME=tiny-nvim nvim

# If using custom app name
NVIM_APPNAME=my_nvim nvim
```

### Cleanup

To completely remove this configuration, run:

```bash
# Replace APPNAME with your chosen name (tiny-nvim or custom name)
rm -rf ~/.config/APPNAME
rm -rf ~/.local/share/APPNAME
rm -rf ~/.cache/APPNAME
rm -rf ~/.local/state/APPNAME
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim.git ~/.config/tiny-nvim
```

2. Run the installation script to set up all required tools:

```bash
cd ~/.config/tiny-nvim
./scripts/install-tools.sh
```

3. Launch Neovim with this configuration:

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=tiny-nvim nvim
```

## Health Checks & Debugging

After installation, run the following commands to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. Check overall Neovim health:

```vim
:checkhealth
```

2. Verify LSP configuration:

```vim
:check vim.lsp
```

3. For formatting issues, check conform.nvim status:

```vim
:ConformInfo
```

For more detailed debugging information, refer to [conform.nvim debugging guide](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim/blob/master/doc/debugging.md#tools).

## Filetype Mappings

This config includes custom filetype mappings to help LSPs attach cleanly and avoid `:checkhealth` warnings
for uncommon extensions and templates. The mappings live in `lua/config/autocmds.lua`.

### Migration from snacks.nvim to mini.nvim

This configuration has migrated from `snacks.nvim` to `mini.nvim` as its core UI framework.

**Why mini.nvim?**

- Consistent ecosystem from a single author
- Better integration between plugins
- Reduced dependencies while maintaining feature parity
- Optimized for Neovim 0.11+

| Feature      | Previously (snacks) | Now (mini.nvim + extras) |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Fuzzy Picker | Snacks.picker       | fff.nvim (primary) + mini.pick |
| Dashboard    | Snacks.dashboard    | mini.starter             |
| File Explorer| Snacks.explorer     | oil.nvim                 |
| Git Diff     | Snacks.git          | mini.diff                |
| Icons        | nvim-web-devicons   | mini.icons               |

> **Note**: `snacks.nvim` is still available as an optional extra plugin if you prefer it.

</details>

## Project-Specific Configuration

<details>
<summary>Click to expand project configuration details</summary>

This configuration supports project-specific settings through `.nvim-config.lua` files. When Neovim starts, it will automatically look for a `.nvim-config.lua` file in the current working directory and load it if available.

### Quick Setup with ProjectSettings

You can quickly create a `.nvim-config.lua` file using the `:ProjectSettings` command. This interactive command will:

1. Show available plugins and LSP servers
2. Let you select which ones to enable
3. Create a `.nvim-config.lua` file with your selections

Example usage:

```vim
:ProjectSettings
```

Available options:

1. Plugins:
   - `no-neck-pain`: Additional UI plugin
   - `codecompanion`: AI code companion
   - `avante`: Alternative AI assistant
   - `mcphub`: Minecraft Plugin Hub
   - `fold-preview`: Fold preview
   - `difft`: Structural diffs

2. LSP Servers:
   - `oxlint`: Oxlint = Rust-based linter (ESLint replacement)
   - `lua_ls`: Lua language server
   - `biome`: Biome = Linter + Formatter
   - `json`: JSON language server
   - `pyright`: Python language server
   - `gopls`: Go language server
   - `tailwindcss`: Tailwind CSS language server

When prompted, enter your selections as comma-separated values:

```
Plugins: no-neck-pain,codecompanion
LSP: biome
```

### Manual Configuration

You can also manually create a `.nvim-config.lua` file:

```lua
-- Project-specific Neovim configuration

-- Set TypeScript LSP server
vim.g.lsp_typescript_server = "ts_ls"

-- Enable additional LSP servers
vim.g.lsp_on_demands = {
  -- Add LSP servers here, e.g., "biome"
}

-- Enable extra plugins
vim.g.enable_extra_plugins = {
  "no-neck-pain",  -- Additional UI plugin
}

-- Note: fff.nvim (file picker) and oil.nvim (file explorer) are always enabled.
-- They do not need to be listed here.

-- Set any other project-specific settings
vim.opt.tabstop = 2
vim.opt.shiftwidth = 2
```

This file is not tracked by git, making it perfect for project-specific customizations.

# Tips

<details>
<summary>Click to expand helpful tips</summary>

- Improve key repeat on Mac OSX, need to restart

```sh
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 14
```

- VSCode on Mac

To enable key-repeating, execute the following in your Terminal, log out and back in, and then restart VS Code:

```sh
# For VS Code
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
# For VS Code Insider
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
# If necessary, reset global default
defaults delete -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled
# For Cursor
defaults write com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

Also increasing Key Repeat and Delay Until Repeat settings in System Preferences -> Keyboard.

- Disable `full stop with double-space` if you see the delay with `<space>-<space>`
